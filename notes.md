**Today's Learnings:**
- I am learning the basics of for and while loops.
- I am completing the cash and credit assignments for cs50 week 1
  
**Thoughts:**
- I was learning when to use a for loop and a while loop. The while loop allows me to establish a variable and then determine what happens when that variable
  is greater than that number:
  
  
- My code:

int quarters = 0;
    
    while (cents >= 25)
    
    {
        
        cents = cents - 25;

        quarters++;
    }

    return quarters;

  } 

It calculates the number of quarters being used because cents are greater than 25. cents is maintained as a variable throughout and is then used to do the same for nickles, dimes, and pennies.

Learned a valuable lesson today, make sure to always commit changes. it does not save for you and it will loose everything.



## June 26, 2023

**Today's Learnings:**
- I am learning the basics of for loops with nesting.
- I am completing the mario assignment for cs50 week 1
  
**Thoughts:**
- I am understanding the language and why it is outputting a certain code.
  
- My code:
  
  {
  
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) This part of the code is allowing the program. to know how many levels there will be. this is the part tha confuses me. how does it
  know not to start back at 0. why is i stored, but j not stored? is it because j is within the initial loop, so it will have to start again?
   
    {
  
        for(int j = 0; j < i; j++)  This part of the code is printing what you want to happen within the line the number of # using the iteration as a basis. 
  
        {
  
            printf("#");
  
        }
  
        printf("\n");
  
    }

}

My confusion comes in with them knowing how many to actually print and when to stop.
