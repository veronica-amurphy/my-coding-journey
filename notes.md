**Today's Learnings:**
- I am learning the basics of for loops with nesting.
- I am completing the mario assignment for cs50 week 1
  
**Thoughts:**
- I am having struggles understanding the language and why it is outputting a certain code.
  
- My code:
  
  {
  
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) This part of the code is allowing the program. to know how many levels there will be. this is the part tha confuses me. how does it
  know not to start back at 0. why is i stored, but j not stored? is it because j is within the initial loop, so it will have to start again?
   
    {
  
        for(int j = 0; j < i; j++)  This part of the code is printing what you want to happen within the line the number of # using the iteration as a basis. 
  
        {
  
            printf("#");
  
        }
  
        printf("\n");
  
    }

}

My confusion comes in with them knowing how many to actually print and when to stop.
